Overall Look and Feel of Ontime
===============================

The overall look and feel should be minimalist and flat. We will avoid 3d buttons and 3d metal looks.
The website should be calm and gentle for the user.

Colours
========
For Ontiume, colours expose our personality to the customers and represent that we are calm and pleasing.
These are our colours:

- aliceblue
- black
- rgb(225, 240, 247)
- rgb(198, 219, 228)
- white

(multiple shades of rgb(225, 240, 247))

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a 'flat' two-dimensional design, which adheres to the overall look and feel.

Typography
==========
We will be using Segoe UI, or, alternatively, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, and, lastly, if none of the others work, sans-serif

Links
=====
Links will not be underlined and should change color when a user hovers over it.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the chosen colors outlined above. One button will have a very subtle pop-up effect when hovering over that could technically constitute a 3D button, however, it does not ruin the user UI experience. Instead, it entices them to press it; it could be considered having a psychological effect on the user, encouraging him or her to press the button.
